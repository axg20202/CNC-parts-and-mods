# Docking CNC dust shoe for 80mm diameter spindles. Designed for use with the RapidChange ATC tool changer.
[axg20202]

This is a side-mount design intended to work with the typical style cast aluminium 80mm spindle clamp. Dust hose opening is set at 36mm - adjust in CAD if you require a different sized opening.

Clearance of the main body and the spindle clamp is tight, so you should defintely check the CAD in your setup to ensure the design will work - this is a large print.

Print parts in same orientation as provided STL files. Minimal supports are needed around the clamp area only. The dockable brush holder will need to be printed with supports. No supports needed for the dock, brush ring or spindle brace. Best printed in ABS with 40% infill.

Thanks to Cheesy_popcorn on the RapidChange ATC Discord group for creating the original design from which this is derived.
